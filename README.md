# Crowdfunding_ETL Team Project
 At the end of this project, i went back to drop the column named aptlight in the campaign_merged_df
 I also changed the function to format the two columns launche_date and the end_date as ('%Y-%m-%d') instead by using the datetime.strftime instead of datetime.fromtimestamp 
 For the database part i reordered the tables in order to handle to foreign keys and then deleted the original sql file
